This Alexa Dot Skill was created to handle basic smart home commands in association with GTHousing. The intent_schema gives an example of what phrases activate which intents, while main.py goes through and handles those intents. The backend is handled by outside sources such as GT and JC, our application handles the front of end of word parsing and assigning the intent of each command. The Lambda Handler looks at the incoming request and assigns it to its respective intent, and each intent tells Alexa how to react/handle it.
